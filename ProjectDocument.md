# Further Improvements + Fixes #

### Enemies
What would be nice is to have more than one enemy per fight and have the camera switch lock on between enemies. Another thing is to have a more robust movement and attacking system, where the enemy will constantly try to strafe left and right. They would also try to time the blocking to the player attacks so the enemy would not take any damage. In addition maybe adding more scripted fights to the story as there are 2 empty cells for at least 2 more fights in the dungeon portion before the gladiator fight.
