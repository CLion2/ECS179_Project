# Death Blow #

### Description
Locked up in a cell for numerous days, you find the guard of your prison giving you an offer you can't refuse.

Death Blow is a first person melee combat game which focuses on weaving in and out of enemy attack ranges to gain an advantage.

### History
Death Blow is a UC Davis student project made during the Winter 2024 class for ECS 179: Gameplay Programming. We always had that gameplay vision of making a game which focuses on single combat with an added flair of narrative elements. This was developed over the course of 4 weeks and has now been formed into a complete prototype.
